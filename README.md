# my useful and mostly portable dot emacs
I declared dot emacs bankruptcy (for the first time) recently.

I don't want to do that again, so I am starting over with the goals:
- keep everything under version control (here)
- make everything as portable and easy to set up as possible (use-package, etc.)
- keep everything tidy, so I (and you) can change things easily

## how to use:
###### small note:
If you plan on using the python setup herein, you might want to have [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) installed before you proceed.

#### clone into your ~/.emacs.d

`git clone https://github.com/elliottkrome/dot-emacs ~/.emacs.d`

#### delete some stuff that is just for me
then go into `~/.emacs.d/init.el` and delete the following lines:

`(load "~/.emacs.d/ek_el_files/ek-private.el")`

`(load "~/.emacs.d/ek_el_files/ek-registers.el")`

`(load "~/.emacs.d/ek_el_files/ek-org-capture-templates.el")`

#### voil√†, launch emacs.

It will take a little while the first time you launch emacs - many packages are downloading, compiling, and installing. Subsequent launches will be much faster.
